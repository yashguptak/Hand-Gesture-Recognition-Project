# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Project
A computer vision-based project that recognizes and interprets hand gestures using machine learning algorithms. This system enables users to interact with devices using hand gestures, promoting a more intuitive and natural human-computer interaction experience.

Features:

Real-time hand gesture recognition using OpenCV and MediaPipe
Support for multiple gestures, including thumbs up, thumbs down, and waving
Gesture classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN)
Integration with a GUI for visualizing recognized gestures
Customizable gesture recognition threshold for improved accuracy
Technologies:

OpenCV (v4.5.3) for computer vision and image processing
MediaPipe (v0.8.3) for hand tracking and gesture recognition
Python (v3.9.5) as the primary programming language
TensorFlow (v2.5.0) for building and training the CNN model
Future Development:

Expanding the gesture recognition vocabulary to include more complex gestures
Improving the system's accuracy and robustness in varying lighting conditions
Integrating with other devices and platforms, such as smart home systems and gaming consoles
Exploring applications in assistive technology, such as gesture-based interfaces for individuals with disabilities
Project Structure:

The repository is organized into modular components, including:

gesture_recognition: contains the core gesture recognition logic
gui: provides a graphical interface for visualizing recognized gestures
models: stores the trained CNN model and associated training data
utils: includes utility functions for image processing and data manipulation
This project aims to provide a foundation for developing more advanced hand gesture recognition systems, with potential applications in various fields. The code is well-documented and easy to modify, making it a great starting point for further development and exploration.
